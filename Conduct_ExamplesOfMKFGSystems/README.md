# Conduct

Putting together new and existing maker tools into bespoke manufacturing systems can enable scalable production. See these **examples of MKFG systems** to get a sense for how all of the elements can be combined to support specific MKFG business ventures.

* **[Artisan Bread](./ArtisanBread)**: This is the MKFG system used to enable [PALM bread](https://palmbread.com), an artisan method for making exceptional sourdough breads at home that can easily scale up to help feed local communities.

### :heart: Your support keeps us going :heart:

The Makeufacturing initiative is made possible by **[Makefast](https://makefastworkshop.com)**, a small, family-run prototyping and product development workshop located in Delaware, Ohio. After many attempts at manufacturing our own desktop fabrication products, it became clear how exciting (and technically difficult!) it was to create high quality products at scale out of our home using only DIY/Maker-level tools. We decided to openly catalog and share these learnings in the hopes that other makers around the world may benefit and further grow this **new, highly accessible, industrial revolution**.

If you appreciate this approach and want to see it grow, please consider contributing below. Your financial support allows us to put more time and effort into makeufacturing so that **more people can make more awesome things in more parts of the world**!

**[Support Makeufacturing with a contribution of any amount](https://buy.stripe.com/5kQfZi9WNeac3ba6trcQU02)**

Thanks, and **keep making awesome things!**
