# Distribute

You've makeufacturing something awesome, but **how, when, and where do you earn** money from what you've created?

Alternative models of distribution provide makers with a way to get their products into customers' hands without the overhead of consignment or leasing brick-and-mortar spaces. Not depending on large online and offline retailers benefits both the maker and the buyer (self-serve, on-site, bulk distribution, direct-to-consumer transactions, pay-what-you-wish pricing, etc.).

* **[Self-Serve Kiosk](./SelfServeKiosk/)**: For ventures where theft is unlikely/tolerable (like bread, coffee, or produce), a self-serve storefront is a great way to allow customers to buy what you're selling without requiring you to be present. It's also a great way to build trust within a community.
* **[Payment Processing](./PaymentProcessing)**: What are the best ways for a customer to pay for what you're selling, and how do you set it up? Can customers be trusted to enter the price themselves? What kind of fees can a seller expect to pay if a credit card is used?

### :heart: Your support keeps us going :heart:

The Makeufacturing initiative is made possible by **[Makefast](https://makefastworkshop.com)**, a small, family-run prototyping and product development workshop located in Delaware, Ohio. After many attempts at manufacturing our own desktop fabrication products, it became clear how exciting (and technically difficult!) it was to create high quality products at scale out of our home using only DIY/Maker-level tools. We decided to openly catalog and share these learnings in the hopes that other makers around the world may benefit and further grow this **new, highly accessible, industrial revolution**.

If you appreciate this approach and want to see it grow, please consider contributing below. Your financial support allows us to put more time and effort into makeufacturing so that **more people can make more awesome things in more parts of the world**!

Thanks, and **keep making awesome things!**
