# DIY Dough Loader

<img src="./_hero.jpg" width="512"/>  

If you've ever watched a professional baker load dough into a hot oven, you've probably seen a "dough loader." These fairly basic conveyor gadgets are a big help when handling delicate dough and getting it into the oven without deforming or degassing it.

For home bakers, most people transfer dough to the oven either via parchment paper (since it can easily slide around) or with a baker's peel (think pizza making). But when it comes to baking bread, parchment can affect the bottom crust (in addition to feeling a bit wasteful), and using a peel requires quick motions that can deflate the dough if anything sticks (often leading to over-flouring the bottom or relying on cornmeal/semolina to prevent sticking).

There are a few other solutions [[1](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/51803/loading-peel-domestic-oven),[2](https://www.amazon.com/EXO-Non-Stick-Polymer-Sealed-Super/dp/B00NGOOM6K),[3](https://www.panimatic.com/OPTICOUCHE_821_76_1232.html),[4](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Dough-Loader/)] out there, but this one is simple, highly functional, and uses things you probably already have around the house (and maybe a quick trip to your local hardware store for the wood).

The full <a href="./CAD/">CAD files</a> are included (if you want to get super detailed about it), but from the picture alone you can probably figure it out and easily adjust the sizing to your specific oven setup.

**To make your own DIY Dough Loader, you'll need:**

- 1 x 1/4" thick plywood sheet (as big as you want your loader to be).
- 4 x 1/4" square dowel rods (these form the top and bottom guide edges).
- 3 x 1/8" plywood sheet (these act as a spaces to keep the belt off of the deck and round the edges).
- 1 x 3/4" square wooden dowel (the handle that the conveyor cloth gets wrapped around).
- 1 x piece of cotton duck canvas fabric to use as the conveyor belt.
- 5 x medium binder clips (to hold everything in place)
- Some wood glue, small clamps, and sewing machine if you want to finish the edges of the conveyor after it has been cut to size.

### :heart: Your support keeps us going :heart:

The Makeufacturing initiative is made possible by **[Makefast](https://makefastworkshop.com)**, a small, family-run prototyping and product development workshop located in Delaware, Ohio. After many attempts at manufacturing our own desktop fabrication products, it became clear how exciting (and technically difficult!) it was to create high quality products at scale out of our home using only DIY/Maker-level tools. We decided to openly catalog and share these learnings in the hopes that other makers around the world may benefit and further grow this **new, highly accessible, industrial revolution**.

If you appreciate this approach and want to see it grow, please consider contributing below. Your financial support allows us to put more time and effort into makeufacturing so that **more people can make more awesome things in more parts of the world**!
