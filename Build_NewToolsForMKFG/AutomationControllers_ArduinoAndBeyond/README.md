# Automation Controllers (Arduino and beyond)

To automate various tasks, microcontrollers can be programmed to sense inputs, make assessments, and control outputs; all based on what a person commands via a basic user interface (UI). 

[Arduino](https://arduino.cc), a set of simplified microcontroller boards and programming environment, is one of the cornerstones of the Maker movement. And for many makeufacturing builds, using Arduino boards directly is a simple way to add the needed functionality and interaction to control a complex task.

For larger-scale projects, arduino boards can be extended via "shields" that plug onto the top for extra functionality. For a simple add-on, this works quite well. But when more complex systems are designed (often requiring multiple additional shield, like motor drivers, and a speaker, and a screen, and a knob), the shield approach grow cumbersome, large, expensive, and inefficient.

All MKFG projects encourage you to use whichever boards and elements you are most comfortable with. In many cases, a basic Arduino board may be all you need.

## MKFG Boards

For more complex, stand-alone MKFG builds you may want to consider a board that integrates much of the needed core functionality into a single board, like the **MKFG WorkHorse**. 

* **<a href="./MKFGWorkHorse2350/">MKFG WorkHorse 2350</a>**: A feature-packed, open source control + actuation + user interface board based on the RP2350 and fully programmable via the Arduino IDE.



## Alternatives

* Arduino + Shields: For some builds, a basic Arduino board and a shield or two may be all you need. 
* 3D Printer Controllers: If you only need a basic microcontroller and motor drivers, 3D printer control boards can be a simple option. While usually lacking a user interface and built for a very specific use case, many printer boards have high quality motor drivers (sometimes as many as 4 or more) and can be fairly economical. Just be ready to do some technical digging.

### :heart: Your support keeps us going :heart:

The Makeufacturing initiative is made possible by **[Makefast](https://makefastworkshop.com)**, a small, family-run prototyping and product development workshop located in Delaware, Ohio. After many attempts at manufacturing our own desktop fabrication products, it became clear how exciting (and technically difficult!) it was to create high quality products at scale out of our home using only DIY/Maker-level tools. We decided to openly catalog and share these learnings in the hopes that other makers around the world may benefit and further grow this **new, highly accessible, industrial revolution**.

If you appreciate this approach and want to see it grow, please consider contributing below. Your financial support allows us to put more time and effort into makeufacturing so that **more people can make more awesome things in more parts of the world**!
